* Rules for dealing with file paths :
- just use file-name (eg. my-image.jpg)  -  if targeted image is in same directory
- add a slash(/) while referencing a subdirectory (eg. subdirectory/my-image.jpg)
- for example, if index.html was inside a subfolder of test-site but my-image.jpg was inside test-site, you could reference my-image.jpg from index.html using ../my-image.jpg.

<p> - Opening tag. 
</p> - Closing tag
Information between these tag is called 'Content'
As a whole, <p> Content </p> is called Element

* Block level elements
- Block-level elements form a visible block on a page
- A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it
- a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs,x lists, navigation menus, or footers.

* Inline elements
- Inline elements are contained within block-level elements
- surround only small parts of the document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content)
- An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document.
- For example an <a> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <em> or <strong>

* Empty Tag
- Single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document

* Attributes :
<p class = "hey"> Hello World <p>
Here, 'hey' is an attribute

<a> : This is anchor tag which can make the text it encloses into a hyperlink.
Anchors can take a number of attributes, but several are as follows:

- href: This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link.
    href="website address link"

- title : specifies extra information about the link, such as a description of the page
    title="facebook Homepage"

- target : specifies the browsing context used to display the link
    target="_blank" will display the link in new tab

* HTML Head
    The HTML head is the content of <head> tag.
    Unlike contents of <body> tag, head's content is not displayed on the page when loaded
    Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document.

* Adding custom icons to your site
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

* HTML Text fundamentals
- Preferably, you should use a single <h1> per page
- From six heading levels available, aim to use no more than three per page, unless necessary

* Semantics
    Semantics are relied on everywhere around usâ€”we rely on previous experience to tell us what the function of an everyday object is

    for example, we expect a red traffic light to mean "stop," and a green traffic light to mean "go"
    Things can get tricky very quickly if the wrong semantics are applied. (Do any countries use red to mean "go"? We hope not.)

    For example : the <h1> element is also a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

    More importantly, its semantic value will be used in multiple ways, for example by search engines and screen readers

* Lists
- Unordered Lists : 
            <ul> 
                <li> Content </li> 
            </ul>

- Ordered Lists :
            <ol>
                <li> Content </li>
            </ol>

- Nesting Lists :
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <li> Content </li>
                    <li> Content </li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <li> Content </li>
                    <li> Content </li>
                </li>
            </ol>

* Emphasis and Importance

    Emphasis : <em> </em>
-   these are recognized by screen readers and spoken out in a different tone of voice.
-   Browsers style this italic by default, but you shouldn't use <em> just to get italic styling.

    Strong Importance : <Strong> </Strong>
-   Used to emphasize important words
-   <b> for bold, <i> for italic and <u> for underline
